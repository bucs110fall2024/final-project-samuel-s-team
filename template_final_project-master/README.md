## Project Description

 I want to make flappy bird but instead of a flappy bird, I want it to be a face. First, the gamer will prompt the user to take a picture of his face before the game and then his face will appear on the screen. The face will then act like a regular flappy bird where it will automatically fall and it will fly up when you press the space bar. I want the game to save the face and score the user gets.
